##  How It Works

1. Elements in the sidebar are draggable.
2. Dropped elements become editable on the canvas.
3. Selecting an element opens a **Properties** panel:
   - Text: edit content, size, color
   - Image: set URL, size, border color
   - button: edit content, size, color
4. The canvas supports drag functionality with touch & mouse support.
5. Reset button clears all elements.
